-----

Player, a nooby Viking warrior, has set off from his small tribe in search of treasure and the Sea God, Aquarius, to become a hero of the Viking world. While sailing the seas, Player and his crew were caught in a terrible storm. Their ship was destroyed with pieces scattered across the ocean and their treasure lost. They were shipwrecked on a large island separated from each other. What will become of the Viking warriors now? What will happen to the treasure? Who will become the next Viking hero?

### NOOB DUNGEON ###

Player comes out of the n00b dungeon, covered in dirt, in the middle of a plaza. A commotion is occuring involving one of Player's crewmates, Sven. He is framed for being a graverobber. They claim that the spirits have been angered and have risen from the grave, terrorizing the townspeople. Hallen is kept in jail, while Player journeys out to clear his name.

### UNDEAD TEMPLE ###

Player returns with news that the spirits were awakened by a master vampire and a necromancer. With the townspeople at peace, they free Sven. He reveals to Player that he did actually steal from the graves, and found a treasure map to an infamous pirate's tomb

**Pirate's Temple**

An old woman approaches Player, telling of an evil presence on the island. She warns him to be aware of the danger that may come. Player then explores the plaza. He sets up a bank account, learns of the island's history, and meets the various townspeople. A shipbuilder tells Player that if he gathers pieces for his ship, then he can rebuild it. Player leaves the plaza in search of his crew and missing ship pieces.

While traveling on the winding road, Player encounters a black cat with a top hat. Unfazed, he continues, when a hooded figure stops him. He warns Player that one of his shipmates is in danger. He then dissolves into the thick dark mist now surrounding Player. As the mist clears, he finds himself in a dungeon.

### SHADOW DUNGEON ###

After Player defeats the Doppelganger, it transforms into his missing first mate, Hallen. The mist around them fades, and Player and Hallen find themselves back on the winding road. Player carries his wounded mate towards an inn, where a young girl nurses his wounds. She introduces herself as Armora and suggests that Player spend the night. 

During the night, Hallen and Player are attacked by masked water thieves. They fight them off, and the thieves flee, leaving a ransom note for the capture of two of Player's mates. Hallen and Player leave the inn, after recieving supplies from Armora, and travel to the water thieves' hideout.

### WATER HIDEOUT ###

After defeating the Liopleurodon and the thieves, Hallen, Player, and the two hostages, Erik and Kol, return to the inn. Armora tells the party of attacks on villages by goblins. They 4 set out to cease the attacks in the plaza, docks, and forest village. The goblins then flee into the forest.

When they defeat the goblins, one of the farmboys goes up to Player and criticizes him and his mates' fighting skills and recommends that they go train at his uncle's farm. He gives the offended Player a coupon for the Chicken Dojo

**Chicken Dojo**
 
Erik insists that the team go out into the forest after the goblins to track down their HQ. They reluctantly agree to go, after various villagers supply the group with advice, food, and medical supplies. 

### WICKER'S FOREST ###

Just after the party defeats Wicker Witch, she releases the spells put on the animated trees, 3 of Player's crew is revived:  Flore, Jaden, and Willus

Suddenly, Kol is struck by a tree, and lands in a werewolf den. He is bitten and starts to turn into a werewolf. Because there is no full moon, he is only partially turned into a werewolf. Erik, Hallen, Jaden, Willus, and Flore take Kol back to the village for treatment, while Player scouts ahead and finds the Goblin HQ. Guards are stationed around the fortress walls, and he is easily seen. He is chased back to the forest village by scout goblins.

Player returns to Armora's inn where Kol is in the care of Erik. He tells the group what he saw at the HQ and why he couldn't infiltrate immediately. A cloaked guest nearby informs them that the goblins keep their fortress under magic hexes to keep anyone from entering. In order for Player to get in, he needs a special cloak from the Magician's Market. Hallen, Brande, Flore, and Jaden leave with Player while Erik, Armora, and Kol stay behind to rest.

### MAGICIAN'S MARKET ###

2 of Player's Crew is found as undercover wizards while escaping from the market: Brande and Lucifer
Player and Hallen leave with the cloak and quickly return to the inn. Everyone leaves the inn to go with Player. On the way to the fortress, a rockslide occurs, and leads to an entrance to a crystal cave. 

** Crystal Cavern **

Player puts on the Magic Cloak and sneaks into the fortress to break the hex surrounding the fortress. Everyone sneaks into the fortress disguised as goblins from Lucifer's spell and make their way to the Goblin Commander's tower

### GOBLIN FORTRESS ###

When the crew arrives at the Goblin Commander's tower, the Commander (not as dimwitted as the other goblins) had been prepared for their arrival and a battle ensues. The Commander escapes and Lucifer's spell vanishes .The the party leaves the fortress fighting goblins along the way. At the entrance, the party is blockaded by 100 goblins led by the Commander. Kol turns into a werewolf and starts to attack the goblins. After defeating all 100 goblins, they take the Commander hostage and leave to return to Armora's inn.




Back at the inn, Brande, Flore, Willus, and Erik have left to go to the plaza with Sven to repair the ship and look for the pirate's treasure. Lucifer, Jaden, Kol, Hallen, Player, and Armora interogate the Commander. He refuses to tell anything. He then casts a spell and vanishes. The same hooded figure from before tells the group about a grand library he is going to visit (having nothing to do with their situation). Since they have no leads as to why the goblins are invading island, Player, Hallen, and Lucifer leave with the scholar, Arthur, to go to the grand library.

The library is on the other side of the island so they travel lightly, and encounter enemies along the way.
Player now has the ability to choose who can go with him on side quests with up to 4 people in a party.

### GRAND LIBRARY ###

The crew escapes the Dragonmaster's flames and watch as the library burns down. They leave with books about weapons, goblins, Aquarius, shipbuilding, the island, and Viking legends as well as Player's shipmates: Beaserk and Talon. 

At Armora's Inn, the crew studies their books when they hear an explosion from the underground village. Player, Hallen, and Talon go to investigate where they find the villagers have been turned into zombies. They fight off the zombies and return to Armora's Inn to discover that Talon has been infected and is slowly turning into a zombie. Hallen, Player, Beaserk, and Jaden leave to find a cure and figure out where the explosion came from. They go underground to find a Scientist's Lab.

### SCIENTIST'S LAB ###

After rescuing Skurvette and Skurvy from the experimental lab and defeating the mutated scientist Hallen grabs the scientist's journal and they escape from the collapsing laboratory. Lucifer and Armora create a potion from the journal's notes for Talon and the rest of the underground villagers. Hallen reads that there is a secret mineral to forge a blade that is able to conquer Aquarius. The mineral is only found in Mt. Elemental, the windiest and tallest mountain on the island. Also found in the notes are a list of the strongest weapons created for the Sergeant and his men.

** Sergeant's Bunker **

Player, Hallen, Skurvy + Skurvette, and Lucifer leave Armora's Inn. They cross the island and pass through the mountain village. The crew is warned by the same old woman from the plaza about unfortunate events that may soon happen and later leaves towards the mountain.

### MT. ELEMENTAL ###

When they near the peak of the mountain, Hallen loses his balance from the intense winds and falls off a cliff. Player grabs his hand just in time, but begins to lose his grip. Hallen falls through a chasm and disappears. While mourning the loss of his first mate, Player relunctantly continues to the top with the rest of crew. At the top, the crew doesn't find any minerals, but instead an elite group of elemental giants. 

After defeating the giants, the mountain begins to crumble and Player and his crew run down dodging boulders and lightning bolts. At the bottom of the mountain, Player cries in agony from the guilt of losing his friend for nothing. Hallen then emerges with sacks full of minerals and two of Player's shipmates also found: Warner and Godric. Annoyed but relieved, Player and the crew return to Armora's Inn.

They return to the inn and everyone rests while Player goes to the blacksmith in the plaza with the blueprints and minerals. The blacksmith tells Player that his furnace isn't strong enough to melt the minerals and that he needs to go to the demon's infernal lair for the right temperature. He gives him a chest to place the minerals in once it is heated. 

Player returns to the inn and tells everyone where their next objective is. Hallen, still in weak form, pleades with Player to go along, but is quickly rejected. Player and everyone at the inn, except Armora and Hallen, pack heavily and leave to the Demon's Lair while Hallen sneaks out to follow them.

### DEMON'S LAIR ###

The crew makes their way to the Head Demon's fiery furnace. They drop the minerals in and retrieve them to put in the chest. They are then confronted by the Head Demon himself. Hallen (who "unexpectadly" arrives) he and Player battle him. 

Before the final blow is made by Player, Armora suddenly appears and reveals to be the daughter of the Head Demon, being half-demon and half-human. She begs Player to spare her father's life in return for peace to the island. Player puts his sword away, just as Godric proceeds to kill the demon instead. Godric rises above the scene and unveals his cloak, absorbing the Head Demon's powers and flying off to Berserker Sea. 

Godric was the mastermind behind the goblin invasion. Player, Hallen, Armora, and his crew leave to return to the surface, where Godric has begun to wreck havoc upon the island. The crew returns to Armora's Inn for explanations on the island's history and about her own past while Hallen and Player leave with the chest to the blacksmith's shop. The blacksmith starts to forge the Super Sword. He tells Player and Hallen that the sword will take some time so he suggests they go see the Secret Man's Secret Hideout of Secrets and the Creator's Temple to pass the time.

**Secret Man's Secret Hideout of Secrets/ Creator's Temple**

After completing a side mission, the crew return to the plaza's harbor and find Sven and the others members of the crew with the finished ship. Player goes to retrieve his new sword, along with a new shield forged from the leftover minerals. Just as they are about to board the ship, Armora asks to come along to use her demonic powers to avenge her father. They agree to allow her to stay and set off on the ship towards Berserker Sea.

### BERSERKER SEA ###

In the middle of the sea on a small island, the crew finds Godric along with the Goblin Commander awakening the Sea God, Aquarius. Godric uses the Head Demon's powers to possess Aquarius. They fight with Aquarius on their ship, but are quickly defeated with their ship destroyed again. Player, Armora, and Hallen are washed up on shore and confronted by Godric and the Goblin Commander. They battle the two and the small goblin army accompanying them.

The further into battle the three get, the more of Player's crew arrive to help. Eventually leading to the entire crew to defeat Godric and the Commander. The remainder of the goblin army flees towards the sea and swims back to their home country. Player is about to vanquish Godric, when he is stopped by the unpossessed Aquarius. He congratulates Player on his bravery and banishes Godric to the Underworld, opened by a vortex in the sea. 

Aquarius grants Player three wishes for his courage. Player first wishes for his ship to be restored. His second wish is to bring back Armora's father. Player's final wish is to make himself and his crew Viking Heroes like they so desired. However, Aquarius says the wish is invalid because they have already become heroes. He returns Player and his crew back to their Viking village.

Player returns a hero like Aquarius said, and tells of his adventures (really exaggerated version)

---Hero Mode Available---

Sven reminds Player that the goblin army is still alive and that they need to go destroy the tribe to prevent further invasion. Player can gather 6 other members to go with him to the Goblin Kingdom

---Goblin Kingdom Quest Available---

Hallen also reminds Player that he still has 1 more wish due to the last wish he made being invalid. The user is able to choose the last wish.

The large island the crew was shipwrecked on has seen the last of the goblin invasions and has returned to peace. Player and his Viking crew live as legends of the Viking World and their adventure was told down as stories for generations to come.
