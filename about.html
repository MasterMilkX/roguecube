            	<h1>ABOUT</h1>
                <h5 style="color:#fff">My real name is Megan, but I'm known as "Milk", "MasterMilk", and "milkX5" on the internet, and "Meggie" by my friends. 
				I am a student at a high school with a center that specializes in information technology.
				For my career I want to be a master programmer and game designer.
				<br>
				<br>
				As a child I loved to write stories and draw, and throughout elementary school that was all I did. 
				But writing alone didn't convey the image I wanted the reader to see, so in middle school I started drawing comics. 
				<br>
				During middle school I wrote a whole trilogy of comics based on a story I made with my LEGO sets involving Spongebob, Patrick, Darth Vader, two Stormtroopers, and Spiderman. 
				And even though my friends supported me, I still didn't feel like they were getting the full experience of the story like I wanted them to. Then it hit me!
				WHY NOT MAKE VIDEO GAMES?! I had been playing video games since I was 3 and it was my favorite activity. 
				Games could combine everything I wanted, story, art, and experience.
				<br>
				<br>
				So in 7th grade I taught myself the basics of programming through a program made by MIT called "Scratch", 
				and in 8th grade watched game design tutorials by the <a href='http://walkerboystudio.com/html/unity_course_syllabus.html'>WalkerBoys</a> to learn Javascript and the Unity Game Design Software.
				In 9th grade I taught myself AS3 and developed my art techniques and forms with the help of my friends. 
				I came up the company name while I was going through a Rubik's Cube phase, and I thought it be cool to have a game company called "Rogue Cube".
				<br>
				<br>
				Making games is my passion, and I couldn't imagine doing anything else for the rest of my life. 
				I thank my friends, family, and teachers for helping and supporting me as I try to achieve my dream. 
				I wouldn't be where I am today without them.
